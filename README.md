# Biostat_721_Project_2
Project 2 for Introduction to Statistical Programming I (R) 

## Purpose
This project was designed to create a function for cleaning air quality data and generating plots of the pollutant variables.

## Data Files
Air quality csv files for 3 years: 2018, 2019, and 2020. The 2020 file only has data from January through April. All three files have the same format and information.
1. Datestamped readings of the following pollutant measures:
    a. Daily Max 8-hour CO Concentration in PPM
    b. Daily Mean PM2.5 Concentration in ug/m3 LC
    c. Daily Max 8-hour Ozone Concentration in PPM
2. Some dates have multiple readings
3. Missing data is entered as NA
4. Dates are in the mm-dd-yyyy format
5. There are no extra head or tail rows to be omitted

## Code Files
1. project_2_working_code.R has the code used to build and test the function and charts. The interior of the function is tested separately before combining.
2. Greene_Bailey_Project2_Markdown.Rmd is the R markdown file
3. Greene_Bailey_Project2_Markdonw.docx is the knitted final file
